In this tutorial we try to apply LoRA to a pretrained BERT model for the IMDB movie classification task.
We take inspiration from this work from: https://medium.com/@pyroswolf200/fine-tuning-bert-on-imdb-review-dataset-309e90b6dac0 
and then develop on it to implement some of what we learned about LoRA
